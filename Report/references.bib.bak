abstract = {A hydrodynamic code applicable to a space of an arbitrary number of dimensions is discussed and applied to a variety of polytropic stellar models. The principal feature of the method is the use of statistical techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables from a known distribution of fluid elements. The equations of motion take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a nonaxisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few percent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.},

abstract = {We have performed a series of systematic tests to evaluate the effects of spurious transport in three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations. Our tests investigate (i) particle diffusion, (ii) shock heating, (iii) numerical viscosity, and (iv) angular momentum transport. The results are useful for quantifying the accuracy of the SPH scheme, especially for problems where shear flows or shocks are present, as well as for problems where true hydrodynamic mixing is relevant. We examine the different forms of artificial viscosity (AV) which have been proposed by Monaghan, by Hernquist {\&} Katz, and by Balsara. For each form, our tests suggest a single set of values for the AV parameters {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} and {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} (coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms) which are appropriate in a large number of situations. We also discuss how these parameters should be adjusted depending on the goals of the particular application. We find that both the Hernquist {\&} Katz and Balsara forms introduce relatively small amounts of numerical viscosity. Furthermore, both Monaghan's and Balsara's AV do well at treating shocks and at limiting the amount of spurious mixing. For these reasons, we endorse the Balsara AV for use in a broad range of applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes a simple model of a star where compressibility is retained but the gravitational force is replaced by a force between pairs which is directed along their line of centres and proportional to their separation. This force was analysed by Newton. It may be considered the simplest many body force because the system reduces to a set of independent particles moving in a harmonic oscillator potential. We call such models `toy stars'. In this paper we simplify further and focus on the one-dimensional problem. We show that a non-linear solution exists where the velocity is a linear function of the coordinate and the density a quadratic function of the coordinates. We generalize this result to include a magnetic field. Our results provide a very useful benchmark for algorithms designed to simulate gravitating gas and we show that Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of toy stars with or without magnetic fields give results in good agreement with theory.},

They provide an invaluable resource for testing the suitability of numerical codes for astrophysical gas dynamics. In this paper we derive the equations for both small amplitude oscillations and non linear solutions for rotating and pulsating Toy Stars in two dimensions, and show that the solutions can be reduced to a small number of ordinary differential equations. We compare the accurate solutions of these equations with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations.

abstract = {The paper presents a detailed review of the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method with particular focus on its astrophysical applications. We start by introducing the basic ideas and concepts and thereby outline all ingredients that are necessary for a practical implementation of the method in a working SPH code. Much of SPH's success relies on its excellent conservation properties and therefore the numerical conservation of physical invariants receives much attention throughout this review. The self-consistent derivation of the SPH equations from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid is the common theme of the remainder of the text. We derive a modern, Newtonian SPH formulation from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid. It accounts for changes of the local resolution lengths which result in corrective, so-called "grad-h-terms". We extend this strategy to special relativity for which we derive the corresponding grad-h equation set. The variational approach is further applied to a general-relativistic fluid evolving in a fixed, curved background space-time. Particular care is taken to explicitely derive all relevant equations in a coherent way.},

A new approach to solve the variable smoothing length problem is described which allows a more stable time integration without additional computing time. The approach is implemented into a new SPH code which uses a hierarchical binary tree method to handle self-gravity. The capabilities and limits of the SPH method are illustrated with a set of problems. Results for oscillating polytropes show that with the new approach the intrinsic numerical diffusion of the SPH method can be drastically reduced to much less than that of most multidimensional Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},
